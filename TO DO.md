# UDP_Chat_App

Basic chat funtionality works. A couple of stuff still left to do though:

Important according to assignment spec:
- Connection request (Connected to server done, working on connection to client)
- Order data?

- Delivered reciepts DONE
- Hash check DONE
- Simulate broken messages with 10% probability. Possibly create a method for this DONE

Fun Extra Features:
- Exit program
- Add Gui
- Add option to change to a new client without exiting the app
- Store message history (text file probably)
- Store client data (database, text file, or csv)
- Add broadcast option (everyone on server)
- Add group chat option


Feel free to add anything or work on any of these. 
Prefereably using seperate methods so that the current stucture isn't broken and things can easily be edited or removed if need be.
